# Overview

Antibiotic shortages have become frequent worldwide, with potential consequences on bacterial ecology that are not fully understood. Here, we use mathematical modelling to investigate the impact of amoxicillin shortage on pneumococcal resistance and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence.

# Repo Contents

- [R](./R): `R` package code.
- [docs](./docs): package documentation, and usage of the `lolR` package on many real and simulated data examples.
- [man](./man): package manual for help in R session.
- [tests](./tests): `R` unit tests written using the `testthat` package.
- [vignettes](./vignettes): `R` vignettes for R session html help pages.

# System Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

The `lol` package requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the operations defined by a user. For minimal performance, this will be a computer with about 2 GB of RAM. For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:

RAM: 16+ GB  
CPU: 4+ cores, 3.3+ GHz/core

The runtimes below are generated using a computer with the recommended specs (16 GB RAM, 4 cores@3.3 GHz) and internet of speed 25 Mbps.

## Software Requirements

### OS Requirements

The package development version is tested on *Linux* operating systems. The developmental version of the package has been tested on the following systems:

Linux: Ubuntu 16.04  
Mac OSX:  
Windows:  

The CRAN package should be compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

Before setting up the `lolR` package, users should have `R` version 3.4.0 or higher, and several packages set up from CRAN.

#### Installing R version 3.4.2 on Ubuntu 16.04

# Installation Guide

## Stable Release

`lolR` is available in a stable release on CRAN:

```
install.packages('lolR')
```

## Development Version

### Package dependencies

Users should install the following packages prior to installing `lolR`, from an `R` terminal:

```
install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'abind', 'irlba', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'latex2exp', 'MASS', 'randomForest'))
```

which will install in about 30 seconds on a machine with the recommended specs.
